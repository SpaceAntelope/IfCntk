            "(**\n\nF# Data Frame design notes\n==========================\n\nThis is the first version of F# Data Frame library and so we are still actively looking\nat how to improve the design. The best place for discussions is either the [issue list\non GitHub](https://github.com/fslaborg/Deedle/issues) or the\nmailing list of the [F# for Data and Machine Learning](http://fsharp.org/technical-groups/)\ngroup (for more broader topics).\n\nThe current version of the library implements most of the basic functionality,\nbut it hopefully provides the right \"core\" internals that should make it easier to add\nall the additional (useful) features.\n\nWhen developing the library, we follow the principle that there should be a small number\nof _primitive_ or _fundamental_ functions (these are typically provided as members on\nthe basic objects) that can be used to provide a wide range of useful functions (typically\navailable as extension members and in F# modules). We are generally quite happy to include\nmore extension members and functions for commonly used operations, so feel free to contribute!\n\nLibrary principles\n------------------\n\n * **F# and C# friendly** - We want to make sure that the library works from both F# and C#.\n   For this reason, most functionality is exposed as extension members (using the C# `Extension`\n   attribute - so they are only visible in C# and F# 3.1) and as functions in modules\n   (`Frame` and `Series`). These are generally very similar. One difference is that functions\n   use tuples and F# `option<T>` and more abbreviations, while extensions use `KeyValuePair<K, V>`,\n   `OptionalValue<T>` (a C#-friendly `struct` defined in the library).\n\n * **Symmetry between rows and columns** - The data in data frame is stored as a list of\n   columns and it is good idea to use the data frame in a column-wise way (and there are\n   more functions for working with column-based frames).\n\n   However, the data type `Frame<'TRowKey, 'TColKey>` is symmetric in that it uses custom\n   index for access by both columns (series) and rows. You can also access columns/rows as\n   a series of (nested) series via `df.Columns` and `df.Rows`. Although the column key is\n   typically going to be a string (series name), this is not required and you can e.g. transpose\n   frame using the `df.Transpose()` method.\n\n * **Missing and NaN values** we assume that data frames can always contain missing values and\n   so there is no type distinction between frame/series that may have missing values and one\n   that may not have missing values. Operations available on the frame and series are designed\n   to handle missing values well - they generally skip over missing values unless you explicitly\n   try to read a value by a key.\n\n   The current version treats certain values as \"missing\" values, including `Double.NaN`\n   (for numeric values) and `null` (for `Nullable<'T>` types and reference types). This\n   means that when you create a series from `Double.NaN`, this is turned into a _missing_ value\n   and the value is skipped when doing aggregation such as `Series.sum`. (An alternative would be\n   to support both `NaN` and _missing_, but there is no clear conclusion about what is the\n   most useful option.)\n\n * **Immutability** - A series is fully immutable data type, but a\n   data frame supports limited mutation - you can add new series, drop a series & replace\n   a series (but you cannot mutate the series). The row index of a data frame is mostly immutable -\n   the only case when it changes is when you create an empty data frame and than add the first\n   series.\n\n   This seems to be useful because it works nicely with the `?<-` operator and you do not have\n   to re-bind when you're writing some research script.\n\nLibrary internals\n-----------------\n\nThe Deedle implementation uses two layers. In the public API, you work with series and frames.\nUnder the cover, all of the operations are provided by indices (providng lookup and alignment)\nand vectors (providing data storage). These are implemented in multiple different ways - most\nnotably, Deedle supports in-memory version and [BigDeedle provides virtualised\nimplementation](bigdeedle.html) that can be used for big time series without fully loading it\ninto memory.\n\n### Vectors and indices\n\nThe following types are (mostly) not directly visible to the user, but they represent the\n\"minimal\" core that changes infrequently. You could use them when extending the library:\n\n * `IVector<'TValue>` represents a vector (essentially an abstract data\n   storage) that contains values `'TValue` that can be accessed via an address\n   `Address`. A simple concrete implementation is an array with `int` addresses,\n   but we aim to make this abstract - one could use an array of arrays with `int64`\n   index for large data sets, lazy vector that loads data from a stream or even\n   a virtual vector with e.g. Cassandra data source).\n\n   An important thing about vectors is that they handle missing values, so vector\n   of integers is actually more like `array<option<int>>` (but we have a custom value\n   type so that this is continuous block of memory). We decided that handling missing\n   values is something that is so important for data frame, that it should be directly\n   supported rather than done by e.g. storing optional or nullable values. Our\n   implementation actually does a simple optimization - if there are no missing values,\n   it just stores `array<int>`.\n\n * `VectorConstruction` is a discriminated union (DSL) that describes\n   construction of vector. For every vector type, there is an `IVectorBuilder`\n   that knows how to construct vectors using the construction instructions (these\n   include things like re-shuffling of elements, appending vectors, getting a sub-range\n   etc.)\n\n * `IIndex<'TKey>` represents an index - that is, a mapping from keys\n   of a series or data frame to addresses in a vector. In the simple case, this is just\n   a hash table that returns the `int` offset in an array when given a key (e.g.\n   `string` or `DateTime`). A super-simple index would just map `int` offsets to\n   `int` addresses via an identity function (not implemented yet!) - if you have\n   series or data frame that is simply a list of recrods.\n\n### Series and frames\n\nThe following types are the public API, wrapping the vectors and indices:\n\n * `Series<'TKey, 'TValue>` represents a series of values `'TValue` indexed by an\n   index `'TKey`. A series uses an abstract vector, index and vector builder, so it\n   should work with any data representation. A series provides some standard slicing\n   operators, projection, filtering etc. There are also some binary operators (multiply\n   by a scalar, add series, etc.) and addtional operations in the `Series` module.\n\n * `Frame<'TRowKey, 'TColumnKey>` represents a data frame with rows indexed using\n   `TRowKey` (this could be `DateTime` or just ordinal numbers like `int`) and columns\n   indexed by `TColumnKey` (typically a `string`). The data in the frame can be\n   hetrogeneous (e.g. different types of values in different columns) and so accessing\n   data is dynamic - but you can e.g. get a typed series.\n\n   The operations available on the data frame include adding & removing series (which\n   aligns the new series according to the row index), joins (again - aligns the series)\n   etc. You can also get all rows as a series of (column) series and all columns as a\n   series of (row) series - they are available as extension methods and in the `Frame` module.\n\n### Vector builders and index builders\n\nThe indices and vectors are constructed using `IIndexBuilder` and `IVectorBuilder`. Typically,\nindex builder creates a new index and returns a `VectorConstruction` that can then be passed\nto `IVectorBuilder.Build` to perform the corresponding transformation on all vectors\n(for example, transform all vectors of a data frame according to an operation applied to the\nindex).\n\nIndices and vectors are connected via an address. Addresses are represented by the `Address`\ntype and they are used to map keys (of the index) to values (in the vector). Here is a brief\nsummary of what we assume (and don't assume) about addresses:\n\n - Address is `int64` (although we might need to generalize this in the future)\n - Different data sources can use different addressing schemes\n   (as long as both index and vector use the same scheme)\n - Addresses don't have to be continuous (e.g. if the source is partitioned, it\n   can use 32bit partition index + 32bit offset in the partition)\n - In the in-memory representation, address is just index into an array\n - In the BigDeedle representation, address is abstracted and comes with\n   `AddressOperations` that specifies how to use it (tests use linear\n   offset and partitioned representation)\n\nTo capture the different options, Deedle has an interface called `IAddressingScheme`.\nThis represents the addressing mode used (it has no methods - it is just an object\nthat can be compared). Vectors and indices both expose `AddressingScheme` property\nthat can be used to check that their addressing schemes match.\n\nWhenever we have index and vector, we need to make sure that they share the same\naddressing scheme. There is a number of things that ensure this:\n\n - Series and frames keep an `IIndexBuilder` and a `IVectorBuilder` to be used for\n   performing operations with the internal structures. These should always match, i.e.\n   they should produce indices/vectors with the same addressing scheme.\n\n - `IIndexBuilder` may not be able to perform all operations without fully materializing\n   the index (e.g. BigDeedle can only do some operations). In that case, it returns\n   an index with different addressing scheme. When calling `IVectorBuilder.Build`,\n   this takes `VectorConstruction` together with `IAddressingScheme` and so it can\n   ensure that the created vector has the correct addressing scheme (i.e. if the\n   required addressing scheme is linear, partitioned virtual index can materialize\n   the vector before returning it).\n\n - `IVector` can also materialize vectors (when using `Select` or `Convert` methods). When\n   those are called, the caller should apply `IIndexBuilder.Project` on the index, which\n   performs the corresponding materialization on the index.\n\n - When the calling code creates a new index or vector directly (typically in-memory\n   index/vector calculated from keys or values), it needs to make sure that the other structure\n   matches too. When a new vector is created using `IVectorBuilder.Create`,\n   the index needs to be transformed using `IIndexBuilder.Recreate`.\n\n\nBigDeedle and virtual series and frames\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe \"BigDeedle\" project implements virtualized data sources that can perform many operations\nof Deedle without actually evaluating the data. This consists of `VirtualVector<'T>` and\n`VirtualOrderedIndex<'T>` and `VirtualOrdinalIndex<'T>` (there are two indices - one for\nordinal keys and one for user-specified keys) together with their builders.\n\nBigDeedle is extensible and you only need to provide fairly small number of operations to \nuse it. The interfaces to look at are: \n\n - `IVirtualVectorSource<'T>` where `'T` is the type of values of the source. This interface\n   is used as a source for both virtual vectors (data access) and virtual indices (keys).\n   Once you have a value of this, you can use `Virtual.CreateSeries` and similar methods\n   to build a series or a frame.\n\nThe most tricky thing of the implementation is often `IAddressOperations`:\n\n - If you already have some underlying infrastructure that handles merging and slicing of\n   virtual sources, then you can implement the interface directly on top of this (and\n   use the infrastructure in merging and slicing operations of `IVirtualVectorSource`).\n\n - More frequently, you'll want to use the `Ranges<'K>` type provided by Deedle. This\n   represents a mapping from some keys `'K` to offsets and it supports merging and slicing\n   (so you do not have to write your own code to merge slices of virtual soruces).\n   To use this, you can use `RangesAddressOperations(...)` which gives you an implementation\n   of `IAddressOperations`. For a reasonably simple example, see the code in \n   [tests using partitioned addressing scheme](https://github.com/tpetricek/Deedle/blob/big-deedle-addr/tests/Deedle.Tests/VirtualPartitioned.fs).\n\nDiscussion and open questions\n-----------------------------\n\nWe're hoping that the design of the internals is now reasonable, but the end user API may\nstill be missing some useful functionality (let us know if you need some!) Here are a few\nthings that we discussed earlier and that we may still look into at some point:\n\n * **Time series vs. pivot table** - there is some mismatch between two possible\n   interpretations and uses of the library. One is for time-series data (e.g. in finance)\n   where one typically works with dates as row indices. More generally, you can see this\n   as _continous_ index. It makes sense to do interpolation, sort the observations,\n   align them, re-scale them etc. (Note that _continuous_ is stronger than _ordered_ -\n   aside from time, the only continuous measure we can think of is distance-dependent\n   series.)\n\n   The other case is when we have some _discrete_ observations (perhaps a list of\n   records with customer data, a list of prices of different stock prices etc.) In this\n   case, we need more \"pivot table\" functions etc.\n\n   Although these two uses are quite different, we feel that it might make sense to use\n   the same type for both (just with a different index). The problem is that this might\n   make the API more complex. Although, if we can keep the distincion in the type, we can\n   use F# 3.1 extension methods that extend just \"discrete data frame\" or \"continous data\n   frame\". However, for now all functions are available in `Frame`/`Series` module and\n   as extension methods that extend any type.\n\n * **Type provider** - we are thinking about using type providers to give some additional\n   safety (like checking column names and types in a data frame). This is currently\n   on the TODO list - we think we can do something useful here, although it will\n   certainly be limited.\n\n   The current idea is that you migth want to do some research/prototyping using a\n   dynamic data frame, but once you're done and have some more stable data, you should\n   be able to write, say `DataFrame<\"Open:float,Close:float\">(dynamicDf)` and get a\n   new typed data frame.\n\nIf you have any comments regarding the topics above, please [submit an issue\non GitHub](https://github.com/fslaborg/Deedle/issues) or, if you\nare interested in more actively contributing, join\nthe [F# for Data and Machine Learning](http://fsharp.org/technical-groups/) working\ngroup. *)"
