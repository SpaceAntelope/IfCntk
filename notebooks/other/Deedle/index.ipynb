It supports working with structured data frames, ordered and unordered data, \nas well as time series. Deedle is designed to work well for exploratory programming using \nF# and C# interactive console, but can be also used in efficient compiled .NET code.\n\nThe library implements a wide range of operations for data manipulation including \nadvanced indexing and slicing, joining and aligning data, handling of missing values,\ngrouping and aggregation, statistics and more. \n\n### Titanic survivor analysis in 20 lines\n\nAssume we loaded [Titanic data set](http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted) \ninto a data frame called `titanic` (the data frame has numerous columns including int\n`Pclass` and Boolean `Survived`). Now we can calculate the survival rates for three different\nclasses of tickets:\n\n<div id=\"hp-snippeta\">\n*)"

To get the\n   can also [get the code from GitHub](https://github.com/fslaborg/Deedle/)\n   or download [the source as a ZIP file](https://github.com/fslaborg/Deedle/zipball/master).\n   Compiled binaries are also available for [download as a ZIP file](https://github.com/fslaborg/Deedle/zipball/release).\n\n * If you want to use Deedle with F# Data, R type provider and other F# components for data science,\n   consider using the [FsLab package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FsLab). When using Visual Studio,\n   you can also install [the FsLab project template](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/45373b36-2a4c-4b6a-b427-93c7a8effddb).\n\nSamples & documentation\n-----------------------\n\nThe library comes with comprehensible documentation. The tutorials and articles are \nautomatically generated from `*.fsx` files in [the docs folder][docs]. The API\nreference is automatically generated from Markdown comments in the library implementation.\n\n * [Quick start tutorial](tutorial.html) shows how to use the most important \n   features of F# DataFrame library. Start here to learn how to use the library in 10 minutes.\n\n * [Data frame features](frame.html) provides more examples that use general data frame \n   features. These includes slicing, joining, grouping, aggregation.\n\n * [Series features](series.html) provides more details on operations that are \n   relevant when working with time series data (such as stock prices). This includes sliding\n   windows, chunking, sampling and statistics.\n\n * [Calculating frame and series statistics](stats.html) shows how to calculate statistical\n   indicators such as mean, variance, skweness and other. The tutorial also covers moving\n   window and expanding window statistics.\n\n * The Deedle library can be used from both F# and C#. We aim to provide idiomatic API for\n   both of the languages. Read the [using Deedle from C#](csharpintro.html) page for more \n   information about the C#-friendly API.\n\nAutomatically generated documentation for all types, modules and functions in the library \nis available in the [API Reference](reference/index.html). The three most important modules\nthat are fully documented are the following:\n\n * [`Series` module](reference/deedle-seriesmodule.html) provides functions for working\n   with individual data series and time-series values.\n * [`Frame` module](reference/deedle-framemodule.html) provides functions that are similar\n   to those in the `Series` module, but operate on entire data frames.\n * [`Stats` module](reference/deedle-stats.html) implements standard statistical functions,\n   moving windows and a lot more. It contains functions for both series and frames.\n\n \nContributing and copyright\n--------------------------\n\nThe project is hosted on [GitHub][gh] where you can [report issues][issues], fork \nthe project and submit pull requests. If you're adding new public API, please also \nconsider adding [samples][samples] that can be turned into a documentation. You might\nalso want to read [library design notes](design.html) to understand how it works.\n\nIf you are interested in F# and data science more generally, consider also joining\nthe [F# data science and machine learning][fsharp-dwg] working group, which coordinates\nwork on data science projects for F#.\n\nThe library has been developed by [BlueMountain Capital](https://www.bluemountaincapital.com/)\nand contributors. It is available under the BSD license, which allows modification and \nredistribution for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.
