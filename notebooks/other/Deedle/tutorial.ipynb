Choosing between the two is\na matter of preference - here, we are using `joinAlign` so that we can write code\nusing pipelining (rather than long expression that would not fit on the page).\n\nThe `Join` method takes two optional parameters - the parameter `?lookup` is ignored \nwhen the join `?kind` is other than `Left` or `Right`.
